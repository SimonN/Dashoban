Dashoban

About:
    Dashoban is a discrete puzzle game, inspired by Sokoban and Kye.
    I've only taken a rudimentary look at Python 2.6. I haven't yet dived
    into the standard library, or explored idiomatic Python constructs.

Install:
    Make sure you have Python 2.6 installed.
    From Dashoban's root directory, run:
        python .

Rules:
    @ This is you. Move with the arrow keys.
    . This is a diamond. Collect all diamonds to win!
    # This is a wall, you can't move through it.
    + This crate can be pushed, like in Sokoban.
    - This crate can only be pushed horizontally.
    | This crate can only be pushed vertically.
